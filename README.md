<em> CVF-DLO Pipeline Overview </em>
</p>

We present *CVF-DLO*, an approach for route estimation across the visual fields of branched DLOs (BDLOs), such as wire harnesses, based on images from different perspectives, using a pose-aware camera.

We provide a two-stage algorithm. The first part is the algorithm for BDLOs instance segmentation in images. The second part is the algorithm for cross-visual-fields BDLOs route estimation by combining images from multiple perspectives.
